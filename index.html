        <p>Hello! I'm Erik. You probably know me as the guy who sits in the middle row at
            class and is always wearing a hat. What you may not know
            is that I am married (15 years), have 1 amazing son, 2 incredible dogs (Stewie 
            and Bowser) and 1 stupid cat (Kitty). 
            <br>
            <br>
            During my free time (when not in this bootcamp), I enjoy playing video games 
            (Playstation 4, Xbox One, & Nintendo Switch), watching football (Go Cougs/Go Hawks), 
            going to movies, riding bike, and playing with my son/dogs. I also really enjoy listening to music. 
            Some of my favorite artists are Billy Joel, Chvrches, New Found Glory, Taylor 
            Swift (all her albums except her most recent album, that was trash), Styx, old Blink-182 
            (with Tom, Mark and Travis) and Panic! At The Disco. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh, and I work full time. I hate it. Not much else to say about that.
